# Course Description
> This course will teach students to think critically about data and their assemblages. Emphasis will be on the sociotechnical and political implications of data via a number of contemporary issues. Students will learn that they are data subjects and datafied, they have a data double, leave behind data shadows, statistical agencies try to re-create them as a data person, data socially shape them, they may be domesticated by data, they may be governed by a dataist ideology and they may be in the midst of a data revolution.

> In this course, students will define what data are, examine the power of data, and explore how data are used, who owns them, and once data are linked, filtered through algorithms, search engines or visualized into maps and infographics, students will assess if these determine actions and material outcomes.  Students will learn to conceptualize data technically, philosophically, ethically, in the political economy, institutionally and in time and space. In short, students will learn how to think critically about data. 

# Course Objectives
* Critically assess the credibility of a dataset
* Distinguish big data from small data, and recognize different types of data;
* Conceptualize data as part of socio-technological and political processes, discourse and as media;
* Identify data politics and critically read data policies; and
* Observe the production of data-based knowledge and the construction of facts 

# Assignments
Submit all assignments to CuLearn, write in 12 pt font, use 1.5 line spacing and 2.55 cm margins, apply Harvard, APA or Chicago citation style, number the pages.

## Traffic Control Room Assemblage
You will have read about the socio technological data assemblage in Chapter 1 of the Data Revolution. During the field trip to the City of Ottawa Traffic Control Room, you will be introduced to a number of elements and attributes of that assemblage. You are to listen carefully during the tour for those elements.  You can of course prepare questions ahead of time and ask them during the tour. In 2 pages max. you are to list and discuss which elements you encountered. Be sure to have the appropriate titles, names, include documents, departments, other levels of government, note software, etc. You can of course qualify these elements, for example, if there is a reference to software is it open source of proprietary and who made it, are the data open, is there a licence, what are the names of the rooms you went into, what was their function. This method of inquiry is a data and technological walk through.

### Late Policy

#### Assignments:
#### Critical evaluation of a dataset
> Look for a dataset related to police shootings in the US and critically assess it. Consider the in-class dataset exercise when doing so. The following is a list of ideas to help you, but do not limit yourselves to these: What is being measured and by whom? How is it being measured? How is it being disseminated? Are there any biases? What are the methodological strengths and limitations of this dataset? What is not being measured? Do you trust these data and explain why you do or do not? Find a news article that refers to this dataset and assess if it accurately reported the issue. This is descriptive precise writing, think of it as a report.

## Week 2 (Sept. 14) – Conceptualizing data?
Students sharpen their critical abilities by learning to conceptually frame a dataset. The lesson will focus on methodological approaches to the study of data and the definition of critical data studies.  The datasets below will be used to inform the discussion as will the datasets you discovered for assignment 1.

#### Readings:
* Chapter 1, [The Data Revolution](http://catalogue.library.carleton.ca/record=b3683612) (26 pages).

## Week 3 (Sept. 21) – Open Data & Indicators
This week students will examine open data, linked data, open data portals, data packages, licences and citizen engagement.  Student will discuss the role of indicators as a form of legitimizing openness discourse.  In class students will compare and contrast the Federal, the Ontario and a city data portal and the most common open data indicator systems.  Students will begin to understand how the concept of openness is framed and data & new managerialism discursive regime, data & democratic ideals, and the production of knowledge and facts.

#### Data Portal Assignment
> Select an open data portal of your choice. Evaluate the initiative associated with the portal according to the [**Open Data Index definition and scoring methodology**](http://index.okfn.org/methodology/).  The OKF evaluates dataset types according to a set of criteria.  Read the methodological guide carefully.  Select one of the 15 OKF Index’s dataset types from your portal and evaluate that dataset against the OKF open data criteria.  If you go to the [**Download Page**](http://index.okfn.org/download/) you will find useful CSV files especially the Datasets.csv and the Questions.csv.  Be sure to explore the Index’s website to see how different Places are reported, The Dataset Overview and read the Insights.  

> Report your assessment in a table, describe whether or not the dataset you chose is open.  Finally, critically discuss the Index as a system. For example, how does the OKF create the indicator and who helps them do it, was anything ambiguous, what do you think this way of evaluating and reviewing data, how data are framed, is this process objective and fair? What would you improve? What was missing?

## Week 4 (Sept. 28) – The Characteristics of Big Data
This week students will learn what constitutes big data, and how to define and distinguish big data from small data. In addition, students will study the nature of big data, and distinguish them from the characteristics of survey data, administrative data and unpack the ontological traits of a number of datasets.  In class we will examine a number of reports and we will compare and contrast how their authors define big data.

## Week 5 (Oct. 5) – The Enablers of Big Data
This week students will learn to think historically by examining the enablers of big data. We will do a high level genealogy of the technologies associated with the emergence of big data especially networks, systems, devices and sensors, social media and a variety of methods to collect data. By doing so students will learn that data and technological ‘revolutions’ do not come from no-where, they are evolutionary and they are socio-technological artifacts. In-class we will examine how the state of Massachusetts is strategically positioning itself as the big data centre of power in the US, by studying 2 key reports discussed in class last week 1 spearheaded by the Governor’s Office and the other by an industry association.

## Week 9 (Nov. 9) – Data Brokers and Credit Scoring
Big data are alive and well in media industries and data brokerage firms.  This week we will examine the political economy of data by examining types of data services, data products, laws, oversight, regulation and associated issues such as privacy, the corporate use of open data for private sector gain, how data get bundled up and re-sold and how data about you and I get bought and sold and in the hands of corporations with whom we have no relationship.

## Week 11 (Nov. 23) – The End of Science?
Many enthusiasts suggest that science as we know it is obsolete, it is now data driven science.  Does this mark a new positivist era, where the sexiest job is that of a data scientists, an era of prediction, super forecasting and fortune telling based on algorithms and terrabytes of unstructured data?  This week we will examine how some areas of science are changing and why data driven science answers some questions and not others.
